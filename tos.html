            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">2. Description of CoinSurf Services</h3>
            <p>Welcome to CoinSurf, where we provide a service that allows users to help provide a private peer-to-peer network while earning credits that can be redeemed for value. After registering, CoinSurf users (“Users”) download and install software, a graphical user interface called an Application (“the Application”), which modifies their network sharing. The services provided by CoinSurf and its subsidiaries (“the Services”) may include selling bandwidth, which are a necessary part of the Services. The Services may also include certain communications from CoinSurf, such as announcements, administrative messages and other communications, and these communications are considered part of CoinSurf membership and you will not be able to opt out of receiving them. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current CoinSurf Services, including the release of new versions of the CoinSurf Application, shall be subject to the User Agreement. You understand and agree that the CoinSurf Application is provided "AS-IS" and that CoinSurf assumes no responsibility for the interaction with, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user information or personalization settings. You are responsible for obtaining access to the CoinSurf Services, and that access may involve third-party fees (such as Internet service provider or airtime charges). You are responsible for those fees, including those fees associated with the display or delivery of advertisements. In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the CoinSurf Services.</p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">3. The Application</h3>
            <p>The Application includes various features and content that is offered and delivered to you by CoinSurf and its affiliates. It customizes your network settings by modifying the system settings on your computer. The Application incorporates the user to be a part of the CoinSurf Network, and calculates the credits you earn using a proprietary algorithm. Credits, if verified by CoinSurf, may be redeemed for value.</p>
            <p>CoinSurf is committed to protecting your privacy and safety rights while using the Application.</p>
            <p>CoinSurf does not collect any personal information from you other than as described in the TOS.</p>
            <p>CoinSurf maintains the following privacy practices:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>No Spyware Policy - the Application does NOT collect or transmit Personally Identifiable Information and does not monitor your personal use of the Application other than for the calculation of Credits. Personally Identifiable Information means information that would identify you personally. The Application sends unidentifiable and non-personal statistical data to enable quality assurance and improve support processes. Such non-personal data includes unidentifiable and general usage of the Application (for example statistical usage data can be sent if you open or close the Application but not personal information you may share via the Application) but does not include Personally Identifiable Information, other than as specifically described herein.</li>
              <li>Unobtrusive - the Application does not enable other software applications to access data stored on your computer's hard drive or in your personal online accounts. The Application does not change your web search preferences. Accepting third party offers is not required in order to use the Application.</li>
              <li>Easy uninstall - you can easily uninstall the Application at any time by using standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your operating system, your internet browser or similar software uninstall options (for example: add/remove programs in Windows, Application removal in Firefox, etc.).</li>
              <li>Easy deactivation - you can easily deactivate your Application at any time by using the standard deactivation features available in your internet browser (for example: by clicking the "View" menu in your browser selecting the name of the Application and then clicking on it).</li>

You must comply with all export and import laws and restrictions and regulations of any United States or foreign agency or authority relating to the Service and its use.</p>
            <p>Entire Agreement. The TOS constitutes the entire agreement between you and CoinSurf and governs your use of the CoinSurf Services, superseding any prior version of this TOS between you and CoinSurf with respect to the CoinSurf Services.
